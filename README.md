# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection

## Project Overview
The Credit Card Fraud Detection project aims to predict fraudulent transactions using machine learning techniques. Given the highly imbalanced nature of the dataset, where only 0.172% of transactions are fraudulent, the project seeks to build a robust model that effectively identifies fraud, helping to secure financial transactions for both banks and customers.

## Objective
To predict fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning models and provide valuable insights for fraud detection.

## Data Collection
The dataset used in this project contains credit card transactions made by European cardholders over a two-day period in September 2013. The dataset is highly imbalanced, with only 0.172% of the transactions labeled as fraud.

## Data Preprocessing
- Handled missing values and inconsistencies in the dataset.
- Implemented data cleaning processes to remove duplicates and address outliers.
- Normalized features to ensure uniformity across the dataset.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Conducted EDA to uncover patterns in the data, utilizing visualization libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn to create plots that enhance understanding and interpretation.

## Model Development
Trained multiple machine learning models, including:
- Logistic Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)

The Logistic Regression model achieved an impressive accuracy of 99%, demonstrating its effectiveness in detecting fraudulent transactions.
